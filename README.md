# PROJECT MODULE 1
## GAME: LIFE OF BIRDIE
### INTRODUCTION
Through this adventure game you'll be able to be on the shoes of Birdie and how a day in his life looks like, all this done through the learnings in the Module 1 of the Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp, using programs such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
### USER EXPERIENCE
- The user can chose between two different modes, fly mode and eat mode.
- In both the user will be able to see the score he has at all moments while playing.
- In Fly Mode it is an infinite loop, so if there is no collision the game will keep on going forever.
- It also makes a sound every time it jumps and also when it collides.
- In Eat Mode it has a winning screen and a losing screen.
- It also makes a sound when it eats fries, and a different one when it eats fruits.
- At the end there is a Play Again button that will refresh the page so you start over.

#### Instructions
  Birdie is ready for an adventure, but his biggest enemies, the caffles, are ready to ruin his day. Your mission is to get him as far as possible. 
  
  With Spacebar you make Birdie jump, if no keyboard is pressed then gravity will pull him down.

### EAT MODE

#### Instructions
  Birdie had a very long day, and wants to recharge batteries with his favorite meal, Wc'Donalds fries, but to do that he needs to avoid his biggest weakness, FRUITS.
  
  With the left and right arrows get as many fries you can until Birdie has 100% health, all this while avoiding the fruits that make him weaker, if he has less than 0 of health then Birdie dies, and GAME OVER.
