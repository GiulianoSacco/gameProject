# PROJECT MODULE 1
## GAME: LIFE OF BIRDIE
### INTRODUCTION
Through this adventure game you'll be able to be on the shoes of Birdie and how a day in his life looks like, all this done through the learnings in the Module 1 of the Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp, using programs such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
### FLY MODE

#### Instructions
  Birdie is ready for an adventure, but his biggest enemies, the caffles, are ready to ruin his day. Your mission is to get him as far as possible. 
  
  With Spacebar you make Birdie jump, if no keyboard is pressed then gravity will pull him down.

### EAT MODE

#### Instructions
  Birdie had a very long day, and wants to recharge batteries with his favorite meal, Wc'Donalds fries, but to do that he needs to avoid his biggest weakness, FRUITS.
  
  With the left and right arrows get as many fries you can until Birdie has 100% health, all this while avoiding the fruits that make him weaker, if he has less than 0 of health then Birdie dies, and GAME OVER.
